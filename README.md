# OpenADR-PenTest-Lab
OpenADR-PenTest-Lab is a testbed for learning web app penetration testing in Open Automated Demand Response (OpenADR) systems. It provides a realistic environment for security enthusiasts to practice pen testing on a Virtual Top Node (VTN) server for demand response applications, grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEB), and OpenADR protocols.
